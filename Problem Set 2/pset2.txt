Problem Set 2
For this problem set, you’ll use CS50 IDE, a cloud-based programming environment.

What to Do
Go to ide.cs50.io and click “Sign in with GitHub” to access your CS50 IDE.
Submit Readability https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/2/readability

Submit one of:
Caesar if feeling less comfortable https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/2/caesar

Substitution if feeling more comfortable https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/2/substitution
If you submit both Caesar and Substitution, we’ll record the higher of your two scores.

Advice
Try out any of David’s programs from class via Week 2’s source code. https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/weeks/2/
If you see any errors when compiling your code with make, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking help50 for help. For instance, if trying to compile readability, and
make readability
is yielding errors, try running

help50 make readability
instead!

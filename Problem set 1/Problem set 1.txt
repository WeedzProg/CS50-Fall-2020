For this problem set, you’ll use CS50 IDE, a cloud-based programming environment. This environment is similar to CS50 Sandbox and CS50 Lab, the programming environments that David discussed during lecture.

What to Do
Go to ide.cs50.io and click “Sign in with GitHub” to access your CS50 IDE.

Advice
Try out any of David’s programs from class via Week 1’s source code. https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/weeks/1/
If you see any errors when compiling your code with make, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking help50 for help. For instance, if trying to compile hello, and
make hello
is yielding errors, try running

help50 make hello
instead!

Though CS50x’s deadline has already been extended to 31 December 2021, this version of this problem set will only be accepted until the date and time above. Thereafter, you may only submit work from CS50x 2021, which will be released on 1 January 2021. Not sure you’ll finish the course by then?

Advice
Try out any of David’s programs from class via Week 3’s sandboxes. https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/weeks/3/
If you see any errors when compiling your code with make, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking help50 for help. For instance, if trying to compile plurality, and
make plurality
is yielding errors, try running

help50 make plurality
instead!

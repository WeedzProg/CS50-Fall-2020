# CS50-Fall-2020

Problem Set 1
For this problem set, you’ll use CS50 IDE, a cloud-based programming environment. This environment is similar to CS50 Sandbox and CS50 Lab, the programming environments that David discussed during lecture.

What to Do
Go to ide.cs50.io and click “Sign in with GitHub” to access your CS50 IDE.
Submit Hello
Submit one of:
this version of Mario if feeling less comfortable
this version of Mario if feeling more comfortable
Submit one of:
Cash if feeling less comfortable
Credit if feeling more comfortable
If you submit both Marios, we’ll record the higher of your two scores. If you submit both of Cash and Credit, we’ll record the higher of your two scores.

When to Do It
By ven. 1 janv. 2021 à 05:59 UTC+1.

Though CS50x’s deadline has already been extended to 31 December 2021, this version of this problem set will only be accepted until the date and time above. Not sure you’ll finish the course by then?

Advice
Try out any of David’s programs from class via Week 1’s source code.
If you see any errors when compiling your code with make, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking help50 for help. For instance, if trying to compile hello, and
make hello
is yielding errors, try running

help50 make hello
instead!
